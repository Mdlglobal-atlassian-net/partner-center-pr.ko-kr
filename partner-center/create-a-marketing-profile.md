# <a name="create-a-marketing-profile"></a>Create a marketing profile

**Applies to**

-  Partner Center

As a qualified Microsoft partner, you can create a marketing profile to showcase your business to customers who are looking for your unique solutions and expertise to address their business needs.

Microsoft engages millions of customers every year through marketing, sales and service efforts. Most of these engagements create opportunities for us to provide referrals to our partners in the form of sales leads. 

As the first step to getting these leads, create a marketing profile. We'll show your profile to customers who are searching for partners who can help them implement Microsoft products and solutions, through:

*  **The [Find a partner](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/search) search experience**. Potential customers can search partner listings on their own to locate partners who meet their search criteria. 
*  **Referrals from Microsoft sales and service employees**. Potential customers interested in deploying cloud-based technology solutions contact Microsoft for help finding professionals who can meet their business needs. These Microsoft professionals can then refer potential customers to your company.

**Pinpoint 및 C2PC**: 이러한 도구를 파트너 센터에 통합할 것입니다. If you’ve used these tools in the past, create a new marketing profile in Partner Center to continue to generate and manage your sales leads. Note, we don’t currently support importing profiles from the previous sites. 

## <a name="create-a-profile"></a>Create a profile

Create profiles for each region you are authorized to do business in. 

1.  Log into [Partner Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=808956) using a [global admin or admin agent account](create-user-accounts-and-set-permissions.md).

2.  **대시보드** 메뉴에서 **조회** &gt; **마케팅 프로필 보기** &gt; 국가/지역 선택 > **[마케팅 프로필 만들기](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/publishing)**를 선택합니다.

3.  **마케팅 프로필 만들기** 페이지에서 지역을 선택한 다음 파트너 정보 및 전문 분야를 포함하여 프로필 정보를 입력합니다.
    
    Note, while Partner Center supports multiple languages, some elements such as the description and free-form tags may need to include text from different languages, as noted in this topic.

### <a href="" id="partner_info"></a>Partner information

Introduce your company, adding a logo and a brief description, and a link to your website. 

The logo can be a GIF, JPG, or PNG file, with a maximum width of 300 pixels. We recommend using square or long aspect ratios. Tall aspect ratios are not recommended.

Your description can be up to 1000 characters. Tips for a great description: 

*  **Be brief**, leading with what’s important in the first sentence or two. This should be the headline that catches customers’ attention. In the Find a partner search experience, we show the first line or two in the search results preview.
*  **Focus on your company’s experiences with Microsoft-specific offerings**. Customers searching for referrals are generally looking for partners with Microsoft-specific experience.
*  **Use bullets**. Break up information into bulleted lists to make it easier to scan.
*  **Avoid jargon**. Use simple, everyday language, naming your offerings for what they do: the business needs they address, or task or objective they help customers accomplish.
*  **Don’t worry about filling the description with search keywords**. The customer search tools search for keywords generated in the Partner Expertise section, not the description.
*  **Keep your profile current**. With each software or service release, update your profile, keeping it in sync with your company's website.
*  **Do not refer to another Microsoft partner company by name**, unless it is a subsidiary or is otherwise affiliated with your company, or you have a current agreement with that partner company to act in partnership and/or promote each other for shared work opportunities.
*  **For regions with multiple languages**, consider including text from multiple languages in the description.

### <a name="partner-expertise"></a>Partner expertise

파트너 찾기 검색 도구는 전문 분야 태그를 검색합니다. 이러한 태그를 최적화하면 더 많은 사람이 프로필을 볼 수 있습니다.

Start by adding your own tags into the Partner Expertise section. Tags you can add: 

*  **Industry focus tags**. Up to 5 industries
*  **Products**. Limited to Microsoft products
*  **Service type** 
*  **Solutions, skills, and capabilities**. These tags are free-form, and provide you the ability to add search keywords that are unique to your capabilities.

Other tags used in search:
*  **Competency tags** are an earned designation showcasing your company’s capabilities.
*  **Endorsement tags** are earned when Microsoft or your customers who have worked with you endorse your work.

#### <a href="" id="#allow_us_to_endorse_areas_of_expertise"></a>Allow Microsoft to endorse my areas of expertise

이 설정을 선택하는 것이 좋습니다. 

파트너가 파트너 센터를 통해 또는 다른 Microsoft 인증 또는 프로그램에 참여하여 고객과 성공한 사례를 소개할 때 파트너가 성공에 기여한 특정 제품, 서비스 및 산업에 대한 보증이 자동으로 추가됩니다. 보증은 검색 결과에서 중요한 요소입니다.

그러나 서비스를 제공하고 있지만 프로필에 표시하고 싶지 않은 제품이 있는 경우 이 확인란의 선택을 취소하고 프로필을 수동으로 관리할 수 있습니다. These endorsements will be hidden from your customers view, but you can add them back to your profile later at any time.

### <a name="customer-preferences"></a>Customer preferences

#### <a href="" id="#target_size"></a>Target size

You can opt out of referrals from businesses that don’t meet your target customer size.

By opting out, you’ll have more time to spend on businesses that are a match for the businesses that you prefer to work with.

### <a href="" id="#locations"></a> Locations

지역마다 최대 5개 위치를 추가할 수 있습니다. These locations appear when customers search for partners by proximity. 

Indicate locations that are official company locations and can be validated. Pick locations that are central to the markets you serve, and best represent your company’s ability to fulfill.

위치 정보 업데이트를 마치면 **이 위치 저장** 또는 **이 위치를 저장하나 다른 위치 추가**(위치를 하나만 추가하는 경우에도)을 선택하세요.

추가하는 각 위치는 별도 프로필 페이지가 됩니다. 프로필 페이지를 업데이트할 때 반드시 각 위치에 대해 프로필 페이지를 업데이트해야 합니다.

위치의 주소를 업데이트하려면 먼저 위치를 **삭제**하고 다시 추가해야 합니다.

상위 5개 위치에 있고 하나를 변경해야 하는 경우 기존 위치를 먼저 **삭제**하고 새 위치를 추가하세요.

## <a name="review-your-profile"></a>프로필 검토

After you publish your profile, updates appear in the [Find a partner](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/search) searches within 24 hours. 

## <a name="improve-the-visibility-of-your-profile"></a>Improve the visibility of your profile 

*  **[Respond quickly to requests](responding-to-referrals.md)**. When you receive a customer referral, a faster response can lead to better results on the search pages for future customers.
*  **Be selective with your tags**.  It’s better to have fewer tags that best represent your company’s offers, solutions, value propositions, and unique position where you can consistently demonstrate success.  That will pay dividends in future search results.
*  **Earn competency tags** through Microsoft to demonstrate your proficiency in our products.
*  **Earn endorsement tags** from customers who appreciate your work.
