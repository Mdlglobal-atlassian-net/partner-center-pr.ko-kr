Microsoft Cloud Germany is designed to meet strict German data protection requirements and includes a German data trustee, operating under German law, who controls physical and logical access to customer data. All customer data, and the systems that process or control access to customer data, reside in German datacenters. The network between these datacenters is isolated and dedicated within Germany.

Microsoft 클라우드 독일은 독일의 데이터 센터를 통해 별도의 [Microsoft Azure](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847992), Office 365 및 Microsoft Dynamics 인스턴스를 제공합니다. As a result, commercial customers in the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) can store and manage customer data in compliance with applicable German laws and regulations as well as key international standards. Microsoft personnel cannot access customer data without approval from and supervision by the German data trustee or customer.
