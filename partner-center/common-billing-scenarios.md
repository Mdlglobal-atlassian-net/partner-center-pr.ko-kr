| [Annual billing](common-billing-scenarios-annual.md) | Adding new subscriptions, adding licenses before your billing date, change license quantity, and suspending and reactivating subscriptions. |
| [Billing for one-time and select recurring purchases](common-billing-scenarios-onetime-recurring.md) | Purchasing subscriptions, adding more subscriptions, adding and removing seats. |
