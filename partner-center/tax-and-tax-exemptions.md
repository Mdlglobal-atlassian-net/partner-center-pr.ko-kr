The Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program is a sales channel focused on partner resale of products. As a result, Microsoft is not always required to charge sales tax on partner invoices. The rules vary by country and/or region. You can review [country-specific and region-specific details for tax exemptions](#country-and-region-tax-details).

Partners should work with their tax advisor to [file tax exemptions](#file-tax-exemptions) based on their locations and where their customers are based.

## <a name="country-and-region-tax-details"></a>Country and region tax details

Specific tax-related information is available for the following countries and regions: [Canada](#canada), [the European Union](#european-union), [South Africa](#south-africa), [Turkey](#turkey), and [the United States](#united-states). For Taiwan and Korea, see [tax receipts details](#tax-receipts-and-daf).

If you're in another country or region that charges taxes, see [the information for other regions](#other-regions).

For additional questions, [request support in Partner Center](#support).

### <a name="canada"></a>캐나다

대부분의 재판매인이 QST/HST/GST에서 면제되지 않습니다. Consult your tax advisor to determine whether you are qualified for exemption, and what documentation you should provide to Microsoft.

For a BC PST Exemption, file a tax exemption as described. BC PST#을 입력하거나 *Certificate of Exemption General*에 서명하세요.

### <a name="european-union"></a>유럽 연합

유럽 연합 회원국의 파트너는 대리 납부 및 적정 청구에 사용할 수 있는 유효한 VAT ID 번호를 제공해야 합니다. The VAT number must be accepted as valid.

Microsoft does not support credit and re-bill. Before you sell any subscriptions, you must [register your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md) in Partner Center.

### <a name="south-africa"></a>남아프리카 공화국

Microsoft now applies the standard VAT on digital content and services purchased by partners in South Africa. To exclude the VAT from your invoices and manage this yourself, you must update your partner billing profile by [sending Microsoft your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md).

### <a name="turkey"></a>터키

Microsoft now applies the standard VAT on digital content and services purchased by partners in Turkey. To exclude the VAT from your invoices and manage this yourself, you must update your partner billing profile by [sending Microsoft your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md).

### <a name="united-states"></a>미국

미국의 모든 재판매인은 Microsoft 재판매인 계약에서 동의한 30 일 내에 판매 면세 서류를 제공해야 합니다. 주마다 각기 다른 재판매 면제 인증서를 마련해 두고 있습니다. 등기부상 주소 및 등록 주와 관련된 인증서를 확인하려면 담당 세금 고문에게 문의하세요.

This may include resale exemption certificates that work across multiple states such as the *Streamline Sales* and *Use Tax Agreement Certificate of Exemption* or the *MTC Uniform Sales & Use Tax Exemption Certificate*.

### <a name="other-regions"></a>다른 지역

If you are in another country or region that charges taxes, [request support in Partner Center](#support) for your questions.
