When you buy online services such as Azure subscriptions, you’re billed for monthly usage rates. Usage-based services, such as Azure, are billed according to metered rates, based on consumption.

Some Microsoft products and services use a "pay as you go" billing model, in which you are billed only for services used. For example, Microsoft Azure uses this model. 

## <a name="usage-billing-frequency"></a>Usage billing frequency

Only **monthly billing** is available for usage-based products. For more information on monthly billing, see [Monthly and annual billing differences](billing-annual-monthly.md).

Usage-based subscriptions are billed monthly, in arrears, on the **subscription anniversary date**. For example, if the subscription anniversary date is the 15th, you will be charged on January 15th for the service period of December 15th to January 14th. You will be charged again on February 15th for the service period of January 15th to February 14th. 

## <a name="usage-charges"></a>사용 요금

The charges that are generated on the subscription anniversary date will appear on the following invoice and [reconciliation file](usage-based-recon-files.md).

You may occasionally notice that some usage charges are missing from your invoice, or that usage from a previous month is charged in the current month’s invoice. This is not an error; it simply means that the service was timestamped after the services occurred. Usage reported within 24 hours of the end of the billing cycle will appear on the next month’s bill.

You can suspend usage-based subscriptions at any time.

Azure CSP 가격 목록은 매월 게시되며 파트너 센터 판매 -> 가격 책정 및 제품 페이지에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 가격은 매일 변경이 가능하며 가격 목록의 변경 기록 탭에 반영됩니다.

사용 요금은 일일 가격을 기준으로 합니다. 서비스 기간 동안 가격이 변경되면 각 비례 배분 방식 서비스 기간에 대한 청구 항목과 해당 가격이 표시됩니다.
